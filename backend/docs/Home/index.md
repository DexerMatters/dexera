## **Welcome to my Blog.**  
  
This is the blog authentically managed and maintained by [me](/s/?path=./docs/Dexer). And I put notes and some works on this website which can be a reminder for me as well as tips and references for learners. I will be grateful if readers could point out problems and contribute ideas and measures to improve 
the website.  
  
In the future, I will allow readers to send notes and posts onto this website
and apply more interactive functions to the site including "likes" and "stars".
Nevertheless, some work on improvement depends on my time and energy. I will
perhaps invite some other people to the development of the website.
