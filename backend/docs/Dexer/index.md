### Introduction
A mediocre Chinese college student, who attempts to make a difference with the codes he keeps writing. I have been doing around computer programming since I was in primary school and dived in a variety of field of development. I think it's more appropriate to regard it as fun instread of self-proving. _Coding is fun_.
